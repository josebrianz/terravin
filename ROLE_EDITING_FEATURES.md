## Best Practices

1. **Always confirm role changes** before applying them
2. **Be extra careful with admin role changes** - they affect system access
3. **Use the audit logs** to track role change history
4. **Test role changes** in a development environment first
5. **Keep at least two administrators** in the system for redundancy

## Future Enhancements

2. **Bulk Role Updates**: Change multiple users' roles at once
3. **Role Templates**: Predefined role configurations
4. **Advanced Permissions**: Granular permission management
5. **Role Inheritance**: Hierarchical role system
6. **Temporary Roles**: Time-limited role assignments
