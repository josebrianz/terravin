- **Status**: ✅ Executed successfully

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Role Management Page**: Verify Manager role is not available in dropdowns
2. **User Creation**: Test creating users with remaining roles
3. **Role Updates**: Test updating user roles
4. **Access Control**: Verify proper access based on remaining roles
5. **Navigation**: Check that navigation works correctly for all roles

## Rollback Considerations

If you need to rollback this change:

1. **Database**: The migration down method is commented out for safety
2. **Code**: Restore Manager role references in all files
3. **Validation**: Update validation rules to include Manager again
4. **Documentation**: Update documentation files

## Impact Assessment

### ✅ **Positive Impacts**
- Simplified role structure
- Reduced complexity in access control
- Cleaner codebase
- More focused role definitions

### ⚠️ **Considerations**
- Any existing Manager users are now Admin users
- Access control is more restrictive for some operations
- Need to ensure proper role assignments for existing users

## Next Steps

1. **Test the system** thoroughly with the new role structure
2. **Review existing users** to ensure they have appropriate roles
3. **Update any custom logic** that might reference Manager role
4. **Monitor system usage** to ensure no functionality is broken
